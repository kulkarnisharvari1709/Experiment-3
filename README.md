# Experiment-3

Code 1
This program is a simple number classification tool that checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using conditional statements.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
To take an integer input from the user and determine whether it is:
Positive
Negative
Zero

ðŸ”¹ Logic:
The program first asks the user to input an integer.
It then uses an if-else if-else ladder to check:
If the number is greater than 0, it prints "Number is POSITIVE."
If the number is less than 0, it prints "Number is NEGATIVE."
If the number is exactly 0, it prints "Number is ZERO."

ðŸ”¹ Concepts Used:
Input/Output operations (cin, cout)
Conditional statements (if, else if, else)
Integer data type
